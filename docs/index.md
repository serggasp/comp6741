# Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is COMP6741 a WAM-booster?

Based on past statistics, very strong students typically achieve a mark that is higher than their current weighted average mark.
The reverse is true for students starting off with a low weighted average mark.

2. What are the prerequisites?

You should have done [COMP3121/9101](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3121) or the extended version of that course, [COMP3821/9801](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3821). The prerequisite knowledge is further detailed in [this pdf](./prereq.pdf).
