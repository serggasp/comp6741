# Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is COMP6741 a WAM-booster?
  
  Based on past statistics, students with a current weighted average mark (WAM) in the high distinction (HD) range typically achieve a course mark that is higher than their current WAM. Students in the distinction (DN) range typically achieve a course mark in line with their WAM. And other students typically achieve a course mark that is lower than their WAM.
  
2. What are the prerequisites?
  
  You should have done [COMP3121/9101](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3121) or the extended version of that course, [COMP3821/9801](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3821).
