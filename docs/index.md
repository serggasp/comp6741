# Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is COMP6741 a WAM-booster?
    
    Based on past statistics, students with a current weighted average mark (WAM) in the high distinction (HD) range typically achieve a course mark that is higher than their current WAM. Students in the distinction (DN) range typically achieve a course mark in line with their WAM. And other students typically achieve a course mark that is lower than their WAM.
    
2. What are the prerequisites?
    
    You should have done [COMP3121/9101](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3121) or the extended version of that course, [COMP3821/9801](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3821). The prerequisite knowledge is further detailed in [this pdf](./prereq.pdf).

3. How is the course taught?
    
    The course is taught in a flipped-classroom style.
    Lectures are pre-recorded.
    During the lecture time slots, we solve tutorial-style exercise sheets, review lecture material that is useful to solve these exercises, explore various approaches to solve (or fail to solve) the exercises, and answer questions about the lecture material.
