Lecture notes for COMP6741 - Algorithms for intractable problems

Use `gen-tex.py` to generate, for each lecture, a simple file ending in `-SL.tex` for the slideshow and a simple file ending in `-LN.tex` for the lecture notes in the folder `./out/`.

Compile with `latexmk`. Cleanup temporary files with `latexmk -c`. Alternatively, use autocompile in Gitpod.

Once compiled, use `gen-pdf.sh` to copy the pdf files into the folder `./pdf/`, add some pdf bookmarks, and assemble the slides into a single file and the lecture notes into a single file.
